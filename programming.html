	<h1>Research about the Cacophony</h1>
	<p>Properties - Its a grey,sludge like substance that corrupts organisms upon contact, I was able to acquire a sample from my own body for I have resisted it.</p>
	<p>Note: although it may have other minor effects if encountered but not touched. Cacophony works by infecting a creature's thoughts first, convincing them into spreading disharmony and chaos. Instruments who tried to resist Cacophony's effects may physically transform into a cacophony Deamon, it is noted that it happens when the instrument in question has a weak mind to resist it, though instruments with stronger minds that also try to embrace it, such as my brother king Tuba II, are able to resist the transformation while gaining the strenght offered by the Cacophony to its host,</p>
	<p>While I research a way to remove the Cacophony from an Instrument I found that there is a way but requires a lot of mages and priests though the process is difficult in itself, its called "Harmonious Cleansing".</p>
	<p>while studying it, I received intel from my informants across the region that some places are experiencing strange anomalies, where they experince unusual yet chaotic wheather patterns, some noticed that they can't use their musical magic and most are noticing corruption to the local flora and fauna, my guess its the other effects of the Cacophony.</p>
